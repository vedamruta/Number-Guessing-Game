# Number-Guessing-Game

JS has errors which would be corrected continuously and documented in the README each time.

**31/01/2023 :**
This is my first ever JS work. I tried to code this MDN's Number Guessing Game using their guide. I don't want to see the solution until I can make my code work :)
MDN guide is guiding me and making it possible. Currently, the code has errors which would be fixed ASAP.
